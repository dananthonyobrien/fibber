# Welcome to the project landing page for Fibber

Here you will find information on Fibber, created by Dan O'Brien as a final year project for a Higher Diploma in Computer Science at South East Technological University (formerly Waterford Institute of Technology). 

## Project Summary
Do your children want a new story every night before bed? Now you can help them create their own with Fibber, the story-making app. They add the details—hero/ines, stuffed animal sidekick, location, favourite food, story type—and Fibber does the rest. Using live data, API calls, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, Fibber makes completely unique stories for your children every time, and allows them return again and again to old favourites. Watch vocabularies grow and imaginations soar with Fibber.
